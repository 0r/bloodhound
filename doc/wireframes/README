Further information based on an email from Joachim Dreimann:

Balsamiq is donated freely to Open Source projects. Balsamiq's policy on this
is published here:
    http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/105924-can-i-get-mockups-for-free-

It can also be run in the browser. Some features linking individual mockups
won't work that way, but editing individual ones works fine:
    http://builds.balsamiq.com/b/mockups-web-demo/

Once Bloodhound is a more mature, active project we can also apply for free
myBalsamiq access for committers, which would be an online-only environment
with both edits and a repository.
